### Frontend for my first RESTful API project

A simple React project I created to showcase my first backend project. Originally created with JavaScript, in July 2023 I migrated to TypeScript in an attempt to learn the language. I had some issues with ESLint and type annotation takes some time to get the hang of, but slowly but surely I'm getting there.
